<h2 align="center"> What Inspired Me 🔆</h2>
<div align="center">
<!-- One of the electronic product that attracted me a lot is Nokia N9, which was released ( i.e., in 2011 ) during my high-school which fascinated me a lot about how cool gadget it is. My intrests grew along with Nokia Lumia 520, a mobile phone which has limited hardware capability but has outperfomed many other android devices during that time. Later with the introduction of Nokia Lumia 925, I was mesmerized with it's image quality of it's photography. This mobile has also provided many photography features such as Long Exposure Shots, Erasing Objects, Adjusting Focus manually, Brust Shots. I find the features and performance of the Nokia Lumia Mobiles to be quite innovative and it's software quality to be awesome. Growing up with these technological devices in my hands always kept me question on how I can build such kind of devices and how I can create such innovative-looking operating system. The Here Maps, was first released in Nokia Lumia mobiles, has a feature called 3D view which awe struck my mind and I kept wondering how people are able to find such unique, innovative, amazing ideas to help people. Later when Nokia has given up on it's business, a group of it's employees have started a organization called Jolla, which has created an mobile operating system called SailFish os. It's User Interface has attracted me a lot, it's interface naviagation was entirely based on gestures, which was well adapted than iPhone and Android devices. Despite of iPhone and Android dominating the market, the team of Jolla have built this elegant and sleekish operating system has inspired me to be more innovative. All of the experiences that I had through out my life, have played a major role which led me to pursue my career in Programming. -->
