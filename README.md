<h2 align="center"> About Me 🤵🏻 </h2>
<div>
Hello, I'm Sasank Peetha, an aspiring MSc Computer Science graduate from the University of Nottingham 🎓. I am deeply passionate about programming, with an  ambition to become a Software Architect 👨🏻‍💻. Currently, I specialise in coding with C# and Python. Outside my academic pursuits, I enjoy sketching ✏️, digital painting 🎨, animation 🎬, and photography 📷.

<h2 align="center"> What Inspired Me 🔆</h2>
<div>
One of the electronic products that greatly attracted me was the Nokia N9, released during my high school years in 2011. Its cool and innovative design fascinated me. My interest continued to grow with the Nokia Lumia 520, a mobile phone with limited hardware capabilities that outperformed many other Android devices at the time. Later, the introduction of the Nokia Lumia 925 mesmerised me with its image quality and photography features 📸. It offered features such as Long Exposure Shots, Object Erasing, Manual Focus Adjustment, and Burst Shots. I found the features and it's performance to be highly innovative, and their software quality was excellent📱. The innovative features and excellent software quality of Nokia Lumia Mobiles fascinated me, sparking my curiosity about building similar devices and creating innovative operating systems.

Here Maps, first released on Nokia Lumia mobiles, had a feature called 3D view that amazed me. I wondered how people could come up with such unique, innovative, and amazing ideas to help others🌍. Later, when Nokia ceased its business, a group of its employees started an organisation called Jolla, which created a mobile operating system called SailFish OS. Its user interface is entirely based on gestures, was more advanced than iPhone and Android devices. Despite iPhone and Android dominating the market, the team at Jolla created this elegant and sleek operating system, which inspired me to be more innovative 💡. These experiences shaped my decision to embark on programming career.

<h2 align="center"> My Research </h2>
<h3> Visualiser for Monte Carlo Tree Search </h3>
<div>
In the field of Artificial Intelligence, one of the less explored areas is understanding how A.I. algorithms reason and why they make particular decisions. As part of this research, I designed and developed a tool in Python that leverages the Qt Framework to visualise the decisions made by an AI-based algorithm called Monte Carlo Tree Search, from start to finish, in a Radial Tree Layout. This tool enables researchers and AI developers worldwide to observe and understand how the algorithm reasons across various scenarios.

<h2 align="center"> My Projects 🛠️ </h2>
<div>
  Here are some of the projects that I've built. Most of the projects are built to improve my workflows by reduing the time I spent on tedious tasks.
</div>
</br>
<h3>Game Developement:</h3>
<h4> Emoji-Ville </h4>
<div>
  Developed an addictive and fun-to-play 2D game in Python using the PyGame library as part of group project. Play as ’Elif the Emoji’, who crashed their spacecraft while heading back to their home planet, Emojiville. Experience campaign and survival modes, helping them collect parts to repair their spacecraft and return home. For more information about the game, please visit the <a href=https://github.com/SasankPeetha8/Emoji-Ville>repository</a>.
</div>
</br>
<h3>Automation Tools:</h3>
<h4> Dotnet-Leetcode-Template </h4>
<div>A automation script designed and developed in Python to automate the process of creating DotNet projects (tailored to my own preference) which can be used for solving Leet code challenges directly. For more information, please visit the <a href=https://github.com/SasankPeetha8/Dotnet-Leetcode-Template>repository</a>.
</div>
</br>
<h4> Photo Suite </h4>
<div>
A automation tool designed and developed to bulk upload photographs to Google Photos by syncing the folders as albums directly. This tool uses selenium to login to your gmail account, list the albums along with number of items in that particular album in form of dictionary and upload pictures in Large Quantities. For more information, please visit the <a href=https://github.com/SasankPeetha8/Photo-Suite>repository</a>.
</div>
</br>
<h4> File Configurator </h4>
<div>
A Command-Line Automation tool, built in Python 3, is used to modify the tags for image and video files based on their folder names, streamlining the file organization process and improving metadata accuracy. For more information, please visit the <a href=https://github.com/SasankPeetha8/File-Configurator>repository</a>.
