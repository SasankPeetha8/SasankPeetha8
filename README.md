<h2 align="center"> What Inspired Me 🔆</h2>
<div align="center">
One of the electronic products that greatly attracted me was the Nokia N9, released during my high school years in 2011. Its cool and innovative design fascinated me. My interest continued to grow with the Nokia Lumia 520, a mobile phone with limited hardware capabilities that outperformed many other Android devices at the time. Later, the introduction of the Nokia Lumia 925 mesmerised me with its image quality and photography features 📸. It offered features such as Long Exposure Shots, Object Erasing, Manual Focus Adjustment, and Burst Shots. I found the features and it's performance to be highly innovative, and their software quality was excellent📱. The innovative features and excellent software quality of Nokia Lumia Mobiles fascinated me, sparking my curiosity about building similar devices and creating innovative operating systems.

Here Maps, first released on Nokia Lumia mobiles, had a feature called 3D view that amazed me. I wondered how people could come up with such unique, innovative, and amazing ideas to help others🌍. Later, when Nokia ceased its business, a group of its employees started an organisation called Jolla, which created a mobile operating system called SailFish OS. Its user interface is entirely based on gestures, was more advanced than iPhone and Android devices. Despite iPhone and Android dominating the market, the team at Jolla created this elegant and sleek operating system, which inspired me to be more innovative 💡. These experiences shaped my decision to embark on programming career.
